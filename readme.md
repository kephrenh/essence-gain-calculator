# Essence Gain Calculator

A simple web-based calculator to calculate the total essence gain between two combat power values, based on predefined thresholds and multipliers.

## Description

This project provides a calculator where users can input their start and end combat power values, and it will calculate the essence gain according to predefined thresholds:

- **Threshold 1**: Combat Power between 10,000 and 50,000, multiplier of 2.5%
- **Threshold 2**: Combat Power between 50,001 and 100,000, multiplier of 1%
- **Threshold 3**: Combat Power between 100,001 and 300,000, multiplier of 1%

The user inputs their starting and ending combat power, and the app will calculate the total essence gain within those combat power ranges.

## Features

- **Start Combat Power**: Input your starting combat power.
- **End Combat Power**: Input your ending combat power.
- **Calculate Essence Gain**: The system will automatically calculate the essence gain based on the difference between the start and end combat power values.
- **Real-Time Result**: The calculated essence gain is displayed on the same page after clicking the "Calculate Essence Gain" button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure and layout.
- **CSS3** for styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** for functionality and calculation logic.

## How It Works

1. Enter your **Start Combat Power** value in the first input field.
2. Enter your **End Combat Power** value in the second input field.
3. Click the **Calculate Essence Gain** button.
4. The page will display the calculated essence gain based on predefined combat power thresholds.

### JavaScript Logic:

The essence gain calculation works by dividing the range between start and end combat power into different thresholds:

- For each threshold range, the appropriate multiplier is applied to the difference between the combat power start and end within that range.
- The total essence gain is calculated by summing up the individual gains from each threshold range.

### Example:

- If your combat power starts at 15,000 and ends at 120,000, the essence gain will be calculated as:
  - 15,000 to 50,000 with 2.5% multiplier
  - 50,001 to 100,000 with 1% multiplier
  - 100,001 to 120,000 with 1% multiplier

The result will be the total essence gain based on these ranges.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/essence-gain-calculator.git
```

### 2. **File Structure**

Ensure the project folder has the following structure:

```
project-folder/
├── index.html         # The main HTML file
├── css/
│   └── styles.css     # The styles for the page
├── js/
│   └── script.js      # The JavaScript file with the calculation logic
```

### 3. **Run Locally**

You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser or use a local server (such as [VS Code Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)) for better testing.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the **CSS** and **JavaScript** files are correctly linked in your HTML file. If you are using a local server, ensure the file paths are relative to your project's directory structure.
- If the CSS isn't being applied, check the browser's console for errors and ensure the file path is correct.
